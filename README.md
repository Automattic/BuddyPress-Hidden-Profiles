Allows site admins to mark BuddyPress user profiles as hidden, excluding them from directories, searches, and making their profile pages return a 404 for non-admins.

## Description

This plugin provides a simple way to hide specific BuddyPress user profiles from non-administrative users. When a profile is marked as hidden:

* The profile page returns a 404 error for non-admins
* The user is excluded from member directories
* The user is excluded from search results
* The user is excluded from AJAX-loaded member lists

Hidden profiles remain visible to:
* The profile owner themselves
* Site administrators
* Users with the `manage_options` capability

## Features

* Simple checkbox interface in the WordPress user profile screen
* Complete profile hiding from non-admins
* Efficient caching of hidden user IDs
* WP-CLI support for bulk operations
* Maintains visibility for admins and profile owners

## Installation

1. Upload the `buddypress-hidden-profiles` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure hidden profiles through the WordPress user profile screen or set the user meta value.

## Usage

### WordPress Admin Interface

1. Go to Users â†’ All Users
2. Click on the user you want to hide
3. Scroll down to the "Profile Visibility" section
4. Check the "Hidden Profile" checkbox
5. Click "Update User"

### WP-CLI

You can also manage hidden profiles using WP-CLI:

```bash
# Hide a profile
wp user meta update <user_id> profile_visibility hidden

# Unhide a profile
wp user meta delete <user_id> profile_visibility

# Clear the hidden users cache
wp cache delete bp_hidden_user_ids
```

## Requirements

* WordPress 6.6 or higher
* PHP 8.2 or higher
* BuddyPress or BuddyBoss Platform

## Troubleshooting

If a hidden profile is still visible:

1. Clear the WordPress object cache
2. Verify the user has the correct meta value: `profile_visibility = hidden`
3. Check that the viewing user is not an admin or the profile owner
4. Ensure the cache is cleared after making changes
